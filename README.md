# quantum_ecg_autoencoder

## Proposed Topic: "Anomaly Detection in ECG Signals using a Quantum Autoencoder"

### Project Outline: Our goal is to implement a hybrid quantum-classical model to detect arrhythmias in heart signal data (using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database).

- Methodology: We intend to use a Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) architecture designed for data compression and anomaly detection.
- Feasibility Strategy: To ensure the project is computationally feasible within the timeframe, we will apply PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction before encoding the data into the quantum circuit.
- Tools: The implementation will be done using Qiskit and Qiskit Machine Learning.
